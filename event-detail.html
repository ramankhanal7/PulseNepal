        <h1>Hack for Health (H4H) - Overview</h1>
        <p>Pulse Nepal, a student-run social organization led by Cornell undergraduate students, is committed to
            leveraging technology to drive transformative change in Nepal's healthcare sector. Our project, Hack for
            Health (H4H), is a Health-Tech Hackathon scheduled for January 4-18, 2025. Targeting high school and gap
            year students from the Kathmandu Valley, the hackathon aims to inspire and equip the next generation of
            innovators to develop solutions for critical health challenges in Nepal, using emerging technologies like
            Artificial Intelligence (AI).
        </p>

    <section class="background">
        <h2>Background & Motivation</h2>
        <p>Nepal’s healthcare system has faced significant challenges, highlighted starkly by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic
            and the devastating
            earthquake of 2015. These events exposed the system's vulnerabilities, including a lack of resources and
            inadequate technological infrastructure to effectively manage emergency response and routine healthcare
            needs. Like many developing nations, Nepal's health sector could greatly benefit from innovative solutions
            that address these gaps.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="objectives-impact">
        <h2>Objectives & Impact</h2>
        <p>By the conclusion of the Hack 4 Health, we expect that participants will have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Honed Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Students will develop critical thinking and
                problem-solving abilities by tackling real-world health issues in Nepal, refining their approach to
                complex challenges through innovative solutions and creative design thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Technical Proficiency:</strong> Participants will gain hands-on experience with
                cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and digital health tools.
                They will learn to apply these technologies to healthcare problems, building their technical skillset
                and understanding of practical applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Collaboration and Teamwork:</strong> Working in diverse teams, students will cultivate
                collaboration skills, learning to communicate effectively, manage conflicts, and leverage each other’s
                strengths. This experience will help them develop a cooperative mindset crucial for future professional
                environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengthened Project Management Abilities:</strong> Students will practice managing projects
                from conception to execution, including planning, time management, and resource allocation. These skills
                are essential for any future career, particularly in the technology and healthcare sectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosted Entrepreneurial Spirit:</strong> The hackathon will encourage students to think like
                entrepreneurs, fostering innovation and an understanding of how to turn ideas into viable solutions.
                This mindset will help them pursue future ventures and initiatives with confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanded Professional Network:</strong> Participants will connect with mentors, industry
                experts, and peers who share their passion for healthcare and technology. This networking opportunity
                will open doors to future collaborations, internships, and career opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Awareness of Global Health Issues:</strong> Through their projects, students will gain
                a deeper understanding of global health challenges and the role technology can play in addressing them.
                This awareness will prepare them to be informed and engaged global citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Communication Skills:</strong> Students will practice presenting their ideas and
                solutions to a diverse audience, improving their public speaking and presentation skills. These skills
                are invaluable in any career and will boost their confidence in articulating their ideas effectively.

        <h2>Event Purpose & Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Our team recognizes that today’s youth, equipped with cutting-edge tools and a passion for innovation, have
            the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery in Nepal. By tapping into the minds of students
            interested in Biology and/or Computer Science, we aim to create an environment where technological solutions
            are designed to meet the specific needs of Nepal's healthcare landscape.
            <br></br>
            The primary audience for this event includes high school students who are passionate about Biology, Computer
            Science, and interdisciplinary innovation. These students represent a critical demographic because they are
            at the forefront of the country’s future workforce and have a natural curiosity and eagerness to apply their
            skills to real-world problems. This hackathon will serve as a catalyst for these students to turn their
            ideas into actionable projects, potentially leading to breakthroughs that could significantly improve
            healthcare delivery in the country.

                    <p>This Hackathon will be conducted over the course of two weeks, with both virtual and in-person
                        events. The hackathon includes virtual pre-events to prep students in the months before the
                        start. Once the Hackathon starts, we will have focused in-person working sessions during the
                        weekends, and virtual or in person events on the weekdays depending on the applicant pools'
                        schedule. Each event is structured to ensure a balance of work and mentorship, with plenty of
                        time for collaboration and development.
