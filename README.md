## Project Overview

**PULSE Nepal** (Progressing Underdeveloped areas Leveraging Students and Emerging Technologies) is an initiative aimed at promoting sustainable development in underdeveloped areas. The website primarily showcases events, teams, and other relevant information about the organization.

The first event hosted on this website will be a **Health-Tech Hackathon**, focusing on addressing critical healthcare issues in Nepal. The current timeline for this event is not stated on the website since that was just for development purposes. Acutal timeline and calendar will be published soon!
